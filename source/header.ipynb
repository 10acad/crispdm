    "## Data Sets\n",
    "You have two sets of data at your disposal. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first one is a collection of crowd funding campaigns performed in the past by different people and organisations at the [Kickstarter website](https://www.kickstarter.com/). The data is obtained using web scraper robots run by [webrobots](https://webrobots.io/kickstarter-datasets/). The bots crawled all Kickstarter projects and collect data which are then dumped in CSV format.\n",
    "\n",
    "   You can download Kickstarter data set here: [kickstarter-cleaned.csv](https://github.com/flavianh/kickstarter-dash/blob/master/kickstarter-cleaned.csv)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   You will use this data to understand the important features of successful crowd funding campaigns. For example what are the common characteristics of successful campaigns?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second data is a Census Income Data Set, which comes from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "   You can download Census Income Data Set data here: [census-income-1996.csv](s3://10ac-courses-data/csv/census-income-1996.csv)\n",
    "    \n",
    "   You will use this data set to predict the annual income of a target donor. Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit company like UCOUNT better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  \n"
